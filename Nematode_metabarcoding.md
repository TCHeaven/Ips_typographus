# Reanalysis of V. Rau <i>Ips typographus<\i> / nematode 18S and 28S metabarcoding dataset

Veronica Rau originally generated a dataset of 18S and 28S metabarcoding reads as part of a project to investigate, primarily, the diversity of nematodes associated with Ipy typographus in the S. Tyrol region using molecular methods, as previous identification has been done via morphology only.

D2A and D3B primers were used to target the 28S region: ACAAGTACCGTGAGGGAAAGTTG + TCGGAAGGAACCAGCTACTA
NEM (forward and reverse) primers were used to target the 18S region: GCAAGTCTGGTGCCAGCAGC + CCGTGTTGAGTCAAATTAAG

These primers were chosen as they target the nematode 18 and 28S regions. However, excluding reads aligning to the host I. typographus genome, >25% of reads were classified to nematoda via BLASTP search, and <50% in any given sample. This left many reads unassigned.

We are interested to know what other species are represented in the dataset amongst the non-nematoda, non-Ips reads. Maja Fluch investigated further by using the BOLD (Barcode Of Life Data Systems) database to assign identity to the reads as an alternative approach to BLASTP against the NCBI nt database (Veronica's method). However, the results of this analysis remain confusing as many taxa are assigned that seem biologically implausible.

My aim is the draw out some clearer patterns from the data - if possible. Below are documented analysis and commands used with this dataset. All commands were executed on the ScientificNet HPC Cluster accessed at the University of Bozen-Bolzano from the directory /data/users/theaven, unless stated otherwise.
